# Dino Web Browser

## Project Overview
Dino Web Browser is a simple web browser application developed in Python using the PyQt5 library. It provides basic functionalities such as navigating to websites, going backward and forward in the browsing history, and displaying web content.

## Library Used
The project utilizes the following PyQt5 modules:
- `QtWidgets`: Provides a set of UI components for building the graphical user interface.
- `QtCore`: Contains core non-GUI functionality, including event handling and the signal-slot mechanism.
- `QtWebEngineWidgets`: Enables the integration of a web engine for rendering HTML content.

## How It Works
The browser's main functionality is implemented in the `MyWebBrowser` class. Here's a brief explanation of the key components:

- **Window and Layout**: The main application window is created using `QWidget`, and the layout is structured using `QVBoxLayout` and `QHBoxLayout`.

- **URL Bar and Buttons**: The user interface includes a QTextEdit for entering URLs, a QPushButton for initiating the search, and two additional buttons for navigating backward and forward in the browsing history.

- **Browser Engine**: The web content is displayed using `QWebEngineView`, which is part of the QtWebEngine module.

- **Event Handling**: Connections between buttons and functions are established using the `clicked` signals. For example, clicking the search button triggers the `navigate` function, and the backward and forward buttons are connected to the `back` and `forward` functions of the web browser.

- **Default URL**: The default web page is set to "https://github.com/debarshee2004" when the application is initialized. *Note:* You can set it to whatever you want.
